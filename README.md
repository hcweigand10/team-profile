# team-profile## Description

![badgeImg](https://shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

This application accepts users inputs that provide information on different members of a development team. The user can declare the role, email, ID, and (depending on the role) the member's office number/github/school. Once all team members are entered, the app will populate an html file that, when opened, will display each team member and their info in an easilyreadable card format.  

This application was an enjoyable exercise in learning more about javascript classes and OOP. The only college class I took on CS focused on this type of content, and slowly trickled back into in my memory throughout this unit. The biggest challenge was creating the html code snippets using template literal but most of the issues were simply syntax related.
